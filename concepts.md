Project Overview:
You implemented a basic shell in Python that supports several built-in commands (exit, echo, type, cd) and can execute external commands. The shell provides a prompt ($ ), reads user input, parses commands, executes them, and handles errors gracefully.

Concepts Used:
Shell: A shell is a command-line interface (CLI) where users interact with the operating system by typing commands.

Built-in Commands: Commands like exit, echo, type, and cd are commands that are handled directly by the shell without invoking external programs.

External Commands: Commands that are not built into the shell and require execution of external programs or scripts.

Environment Variables: These are dynamic variables that can affect the behavior of processes or programs in the operating system. Examples include PATH and HOME.

Path Handling: Manipulating and navigating through directories in the file system.

Error Handling: Dealing with errors that arise during command execution, such as file not found or permission denied.

Subprocess Execution: Running external commands or scripts from within Python using subprocess.run().

Detailed Definitions:
Shell: A shell is a user interface for access to an operating system's services. It allows users to execute commands by typing them directly into the interface.

Built-in Commands: These are commands that are part of the shell itself and are executed directly by the shell without spawning a new process. Examples include exit, echo, cd, and type.

External Commands: Commands that are not built into the shell and require the execution of external programs or scripts. These are executed using subprocesses.

Environment Variables: Variables that are part of the operating system's environment and are accessible to all processes running under that environment. Examples include PATH (which specifies directories to search for executable files) and HOME (which specifies the user's home directory).

Path Handling: Manipulating file paths, including constructing absolute or relative paths, checking if a path exists (os.path.exists()), joining paths (os.path.join()), and accessing directory contents.

Error Handling: Managing and responding to errors that occur during program execution, such as handling FileNotFoundError when attempting to change directories or executing commands.

Subprocess Execution: Running external commands or scripts from within Python. This is achieved using subprocess.run() to launch new processes, capture their output, and handle their input/output streams.

Command Line Interface (CLI): A text-based interface where users interact with the computer by typing commands. Your shell mimics this interface by displaying a prompt ($ ), accepting user input, and responding accordingly.

Methods Used:
sys.stdout.write(): Writes output to the standard output (stdout) stream.

sys.stdout.flush(): Flushes the standard output buffer, ensuring that output is written immediately.

input(): Reads a line of input from the user.

str.strip(): Removes leading and trailing whitespace characters from a string.

str.split(): Splits a string into a list of substrings based on whitespace by default, or based on a specified delimiter.

os.environ.get(): Retrieves the value of an environment variable.

os.path.join(): Joins one or more path components intelligently, taking into account the operating system's path separator.

os.access(): Checks whether a file or directory can be accessed with the specified mode (e.g., os.X_OK for executable).

os.chdir(): Changes the current working directory.

subprocess.run(): Executes a command with arguments, waits for it to complete, and returns a CompletedProcess instance representing the result.

Summary:
Your shell project demonstrates fundamental concepts in system programming, including handling user input, executing commands, managing directories, and interacting with the operating system environment. It integrates error handling to ensure robustness and provides a basic command-line interface similar to traditional Unix shells. This project helps deepen your understanding of how shells operate and interact with the underlying operating system.
